**Summary**

- The problem the paper aims to solve

  - Key-Value Separated LSM-Stores (WiscKey) introduces extra query and insert overhead while doing Garbage Collection.
  - Unnecessary rewrites for cold KV pairs - Write amplification.

- How can the paper address the problem? What is the main idea of this paper?

  - **Hash-based Data Grouping**

    (1) Partition isolation: hash(Key) -> Partition.

    (2) KV pairs with same key are segmented into same group;

  - **Group-Based Garbage Collection**

    (1) Select the segment group with the largest amount of writes.

    (2) Using hash table (No LSM-tree queries required).
    
  - **Hotness Awareness**

    (1) Tagging for Hot-cold value separation.

    (2) Cold values are separately stored.
    
  - **Selective KV Separation**

    (1) Large values: KV separation.

    (2) Small values: stored entirely in LSM-tree.

- Validations

  The results of experimentation and analysis show that through the elimination of mixture of hot and cold data, HashKV can achieve better throughput and reduce write amplification.

**Strengthens**  

- The idea of splitting KV pairs into segments based on hash of keys is interesting.

---

**Weaknesses**  

- For Hash-based Data Grouping, The Hash function is important. But it's not mentioned in the paper.
- The overhead introduced by HashKV is not evaluated.

**Comments**  

- The comparison object and organization of the experiment are a bit strange.
